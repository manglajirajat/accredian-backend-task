A comprehensive list of programs that users can join by referring friends and earning bonuses, along with the names of these programs, must be included.

Upon account creation, a unique referral code is automatically generated for each user. When a user wishes to benefit from sharing their referral, they must share it with another user.

With this in mind, the referral data should be managed properly by the backend, ensuring that both users receive the benefits simultaneously.
